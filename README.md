Attendance Filtering Web Application:



This project is a Flask-based web application designed to automate the process of filtering student attendance data. Users can upload multiple CSV files containing attendance records, specify a custom attendance threshold (e.g., 75%, 80%), and download a file listing students whose attendance falls below the threshold. The app handles data cleaning, file validation, and error handling to ensure accurate results.
